# Physiotherapy Exercise Recognition
A Python program that recognizes bad posture, dumbbell exercise and arm exercises.

# Introduction:
This program consists of 3 different modes. These modes are posture tracking, dumbbell exercise and arm exercise counter.

While in posture mode, the program detects whether your posture is correct by calculating your neck and back angle and warns you if your posture remains incorrect for a certain period of time.
In dumbbell exercise mode, it counts how many repetitions you do. In arm exercise mode, it calculates the time you keep your arm in the air and the number of arm lifts.
